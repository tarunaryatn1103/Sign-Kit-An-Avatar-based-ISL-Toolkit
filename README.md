# Sign-Kit: An Avatar-based ISL Toolkit

A comprehensive toolkit for Indian Sign Language (ISL) using 3D avatars and animations, implemented with both OpenGL and ThreeJS technologies.

## Project Overview

Sign-Kit is an innovative project that provides a platform for learning and practicing Indian Sign Language through interactive 3D avatars. The project includes two main implementations:

- **OpenGL Implementation**: Native C++ implementation using OpenGL for high-performance graphics
- **ThreeJS Implementation**: Web-based implementation using Three.js for cross-platform accessibility
